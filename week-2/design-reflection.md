### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My sites primary goal is to inform the visitors of my site a snapshot into my life's past present and future. My site with show my blog during my DBC process and beyond, a background about my self, and eventually my projects I have completed.

### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience's interests will be to get a better idea of myself and the projects I have worked on to inform the DBC community and potential hiring individuals.

### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
The primary action would allow the visitor to search for information about me, and for a more professional user, a way to contact me and review my portfolio.
### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
What is most important to know about user experience and design is that is it not a 'one fits all' sort of experience. The design must be tailored to the goals, values, and production process for the website.
### What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experiance (UX) is how a person feals when interfacing with a system, weather that system is a website, web application, or other software. This is incredibly valuable because its the focus on others and their needs with the system. For example, if the system is difficult to use, or not useful, the user could be 'turned off' or unsatisfied and be unwilling to use the system.
### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
While I do not believe that it was tedious, I had the most issues getting the image to work within this design refelction file. It kept breaking and had to keep pushing the same file until I got it right.
