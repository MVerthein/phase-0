# # Cipher Challenge

# # I worked on this challenge [by myself, with:]
# # I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# # 1. Solution
# # Write your comments on what each thing is doing.
# # If you have difficulty, go into IRB and play with the methods.

# def dr_evils_cipher(coded_message)
#   input = coded_message.downcase.split("") # Check out this method in IRB to see how it works! Also refer to the Ruby docs.
#   #Turning our input to all lowercase letters, split is creating an array of the input with each letter as its own element.
#   decoded_sentence = [] #We're creating an empty array to push the decoded sentence into.
#   cipher = {"e" => "a",   # This is technically a shift of four letters...Can you think of a way to automate this? Is a hash
#     #If we use an array of letters, we can manipulate the index to take each letter and cipher it to the 4 letters prior.
#             "f" => "b",   # the best data structure for this problem? What are the pros and cons of hashes?
#     #No, an array will be fine because manually setting values for these keys is unnessecary if we iterate over an array's index.
#             "g" => "c",
#             "h" => "d",
