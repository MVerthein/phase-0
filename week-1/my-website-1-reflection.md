Open Source is a free based software that allows anyone to use and modify the program as they would like.
I personally like the idea of open source software, as an individual that is just starting out in the development field, I feel like being able to freely use Open Source software would be beneficial.
Liscenses are very important for the use of software, while the original creator of the software maintains the original copy right, they can administor liscenses for others to use software their others needs. With Open Source liscenses, these are free for anyone.
Mainly using all of the git commands that we have started in 1.5, creating a branch, using that branch to modify files, then adding those files and push the origin branch to the repository and merging. All completly foreign concepts to me have begun to cement into concepts I can maintain and build upon.
I did do some extra research at git-scm.com I had did some research on deleting branches, and learned the difference between -d and -D in git.
