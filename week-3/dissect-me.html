        This is the first week of Phase 0 at Dev Bootcamp, and so far it has been pretty overwhelming and amazing. I went into this program knowing next to nothing and so far learned a ton in the command crash course and with git.

          Diving staight into it, version control gives you control and access to all versions of your work. With version control, you can work on a single project and be able to jump around between a number of different versions of the same project. Then you can compare changes over time, and if others are working on the same project, you can also see who last modified the project and when they last modified it.
        </p>

          Git uses branches to help track changes, when creating and making changes to files, you can make a new branch when making changes so you have multiple versions of the same file. Git then provides a history of the content changes made and can also favilitate collaborative changes to file.

          The best reason to use GitHub is the ease of use and the ability to easily share your repositories with others. Using git command-line interface makes it easy to make, edit, and store repostories onto GitHub.

<!--What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

  In this challenge I used nav, main, section and will continue to return to these often because they will be where in input my blog posts. The main and section specifically will have the content of my blog while the nav will have links to other pages on my site.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  All of the elements within the body tag to laid out on the page, which will include headers, images, links, and paragraphs. The browser will use the opening tag which will including an attribute and the value, the enclosed text content which will display the element then the closing tag to tell the browser to stop that tag.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

  I learned about snippets the most, there are a number of things that I still do now know about Sublime, but in this challenge snippets was completely new to me. I really enjoyed using snippets in this challange and do want to add more snippets later. Any shortcuts I can learn in the future will be helpful and plan to implement.-->
