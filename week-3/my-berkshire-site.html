<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  - It was quite interesting translating my previous learning with HTML into an actual site, my previous HTML was limited to codecadamy, and using those skills, while working with as a pair was great.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  - It was infomative, if there wasn't a tag or idea that I didn't know, it was easy researching new elements, and the tags used were simple to understand.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  - I did well, the instructions were clear to stay away from formatting in HTML as it is a bad practice, so I stayed away.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  - So far, I haven't thought much that is bad about HTML, the tags used are very intuitive and easy to remember.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  - The tricks are to remember that tags and how to write HTML are self explanitory, the tags make sense, in command and opening and closing.
