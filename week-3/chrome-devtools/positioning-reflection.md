###How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
*I will personally want to be Chrome's DevTools to help format and and position elements on the fly, being able to see change immediately, and adjust as you need.
###How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
*To resize elements using CSS you can change the height and weight using px or em. In addition to those, using padding allows for greater use of the element for what is needed.
###What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
*Absolute: Is taken out of normal flow, not affected of any surrounding elements. Moves as users scroll up and down the page.
*Fixed: This is a form of absolute positioning that does not affect the position of surrounding elements but also do NOT move as users scroll up and down the page.
*Static: This lets the element use the normal behavior, top, right, bottom, and left properties do not apply to this position.
*Relative:  This moves an element from the normal position it would be to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been, but does not affect the position of surrounding elements.
###What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
*Margin is the amount of space between different elements, the border is the element that goes around the object, and the padding is the amout of space inside the given object.
###What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
*I think it was a good and interesting challenge, I was unaware of the Chrome DevTools and how to work it, using this will help develop my website easier than going back to my css page while adjusting elements.
